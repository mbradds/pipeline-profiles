Currently available data does not show a risk to the surface water body to the east. The need for clean-up work to mitigate environmental risk will be determined based on the results of most recent environmental assessment.","Description of remedial activities completed and in progress and their outcomes to date:
In response to the abovementioned flowline release, a number of assessment and remedial activities were completed in 2020. The objective of this work was to characterize the released material, delineate the impacted area, and manage risk to identified environmental receptors (surface water body to the east). 

An initial soil assessment program was conducted via hand auger immediately following the release. The results of this program were used to inform a supplementary assessment program, which involved using a drill rig to collect soil samples and install monitoring wells. Groundwater and surface water samples were also collected as part of this program. An excavation was conducted at the location of the flowline failure.

Chloride and electrical conductivity (EC) were used as soil indicator parameters to assess the extent of the release. The release location contains known pre-existing historical hydrocarbon impacts. Analysis of the soil sampling results (from the initial and supplementary environmental assessments) showed some migration of the released material along the flowline corridor, with limited lateral movement away from the flowline. Locations where elevated chloride and EC were detected in soil were largely removed during the excavation at the release location. 

Limited groundwater data was able to be collected from newly installed wells. Collected chloride and hydrocarbon data did not exceed applied CCME criteria. Surface water samples were collected from four locations along the surface water body to the east. Hydrocarbons were not detected in any of these samples.  Chloride concentrations were consistent across the sampling locations (including one up-gradient location) and did not indicate changes in water quality attributable to the spill.","Planned remedial activities including an anticipated timeline:
In 2021, Imperial plans to delineate potential impacts along the flowline corridor by collecting soil samples to the north and south of the release location. Imperial also plans to conduct a groundwater and surface water monitoring program. Groundwater wells in the vicinity of the release location and the surface water body to the east of the release location will be sampled twice in 2021. 

Planned development of reports (e.g., remedial action plan, risk management plan, closure report) and justification for the report being developed, including a timeline for report submission to the CER:
An assessment report on the abovementioned 2021 activities will be prepared and submitted to the CER following the field execution and data analysis. At this time, next steps will be evaluated. Due to the operating infrastructure in the vicinity of the release and the pre-existing historical impacts, a risk management approach is expected to be the most appropriate strategy for managing residual impacts associated with this release.",2021

Laboratory analytical results for the soil samples collected from within the area of concern during the Phase 2 ESA indicated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons (F3 and F4) and methanol that exceeded the applicable Alberta Tier 1 soil remediation guidelines.
As the riser site is located within an area of caribou and grizzly bear habitat and the work was planned to fall within the restricted activity period for caribou, a wildlife sweep was completed prior to initiating the planned remediation and abandonment work. A sample of impacted material was collected during the
wildlife sweep on February 17, 2021 for landfill analysis.
Two rounds of soil remediation with associated confirmatory sampling were completed at the site between February 26 and February 29, 2021.
Once it was confirmed that all impacted material had been removed, with the receipt of clean confirmatory laboratory analytical results, the excavated area was backfilled. As the riser site is located adjacent to a wetland area with organic soils present only a small amount of clay was backfilled in the excavation. The remainder of the excavation was loosely backfilled with clean sawdust and surrounding organic material to ensure the contour was blended and consistent with the adjacent land.","No further remediation work is required.
