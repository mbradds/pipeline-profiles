Alliance,"From 2000 to 2015, Alliance was supported by 15-year firm transportation contracts. In 2015, the Board approved Alliance's new services and tolls, and granted Alliance discretion in setting bid floors for seasonal firm service between 100% and 125% of the applicable 5-Year firm toll, and up to 125%, for interruptible service. Shippers pay lower term-differentiated tolls if they contract for service for a longer period of time and tolls are charged by zone. Zone 1 includes all receipt points downstream of the Blueberry Hill Compressor Station near Gordondale, Alberta. Zone 2 includes the Blueberry Hill Compressor Station and all receipt points upstream of that station. Alliance also has a notional point known as the Alliance Trading Pool (ATP) where natural gas can be traded. Shippers have the option of contracting for service to or from the ATP only, or using the traditional full path service."

EnbridgeFSP,"From 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2021, Canadian Mainline tolls were set in accordance with the Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS), a 10-year negotiated settlement. It established Canadian local tolls for all volumes shipped within Canada as well as international joint tolls for volumes transported into the U.S. 

In December 2019, Enbridge filed an application with the CER for approval of a new service and tolling framework, seeking to have it in place when the CTS expired. Enbridge proposed to offer long-term contracts on the Canadian Mainline for up to 90% of the capacity, with at least 10% of capacity remaining available for uncommitted service. In November 2021, the CER denied the proposal. [Folder 3890507].

The Flanagan South Pipeline System interconnects with the Enbridge Mainline at Enbridge’s Flanagan Terminal, near Pontiac, Illinois, and serves delivery points in the state of Texas. Shippers pay international joint tolls for crude oil shipped from Canadian receipt points on the Enbridge Mainline to delivery points served by the Flanagan South Pipeline System. These tolls are based on the various pipeline routes (combinations of receipt and delivery points), type of commodity, volumes, length of contractual term, and open season.
"
EnbridgeLine9,"Line 9 International Joint Tolls (IJT) are inclusive of service on the Enbridge Mainline system. Line 9 IJTs apply to crude oil that is transported from Canadian Mainline receipt points in western Canada, across international boundaries near Gretna, Manitoba, and Sarnia, Ontario, to Line 9 delivery points at either Nanticoke, Ontario, or Montreal, Quebec. The Committed IJTs are determined using the transportation charges on the Enbridge Mainline and several additional surcharges. The Uncommitted IJTs are set at a premium such that it does not exceed 122% of the Committed IJT for the same path.
Line 9 local tolls apply to transportation service from Sarnia, Ontario, to Montreal, Quebec.

Keystone,"Keystone initially served the Wood River and Patoka delivery points, then expanded to Cushing in 2011, Port Arthur in 2014, and Houston in 2016. 

Keystone negotiated its committed local Canadian tolls with shippers. Committed toll levels on Keystone vary based on contract term length, contract type, product type and ultimate U.S. delivery point. Committed tolls are comprised of a fixed and variable component. The fixed toll component is designed to recover capital invested and the variable toll component flows-through actual operating, maintenance and administrative costs on an annual basis. 

For delivery to Port Arthur and Houston, Keystone and committed shippers negotiated contract terms for 20-year A and 20-year B in the 2015 and 2017 open seasons, respectively. The A and B contract terms have different fixed toll components.

Keystone reserves a minimum of 35 000 barrels per day of nominal capacity for uncommitted service. Canadian uncommitted tolls are available for uncommitted service from Hardisty, Alberta to the international boundary near Haskett, Manitoba. The toll varies based on the ultimate U.S. delivery point, where the maximum uncommitted toll for service to Wood River or Patoka is 120% of the 5-year committed toll to Patoka, and the maximum uncommitted toll for service to Cushing, Port Arthur, and Houston is 120% of the 10-year committed toll to Cushing. Keystone also offers uncommitted shippers an international joint rate to ship crude oil from Canada to the U.S., ending in Texas.

NGTL,"NGTL has operated under Revenue Requirement Settlements since 2010 and is currently operating under the 2020-2024 Revenue Requirement Settlement. Tolls on NGTL reflect the terms of the Settlement and are based on a cost of service model. 

On NGTL, customers contract separately for delivery and receipt services. 
•	Firm Transportation Delivery (FT-D) tolls are calculated based on the delivery points and service offering, which are categorized as Group 1 Delivery Points (interconnection points with major downstream pipeline systems), Group 2 Delivery Points (any delivery point that is not a Group 1 or Group 3 delivery point), and Group 3 Delivery Points (non-Group 1 Delivery Points and premium service). In the graph below, FT-D 1-year term tolls are shown for the average of Group 1 Delivery Points, all Group 2 Delivery Points, and all Group 3 Delivery Points.
•	Firm Transportation Receipt (FT-R) tolls are receipt point specific and subject to pricing floors and ceilings of +/- 8¢/Mcf from the average FT-R rate. FT-R shippers on the North Montney Mainline segment of the NGTL system are also subject to an additional surcharge. In the graph below, FT-R 3-year term tolls are shown for the average rate at all receipt points.

In March 2020, the CER approved NGTL’s application for the System Rate Design and Services [Folder 3752364].  The application outlined the rate design methodology and terms and conditions of service for the NGTL system, as well as for a surcharge formula to be paid by FT-R shippers on the North Montney Mainline segment of the NGTL system.  It was supported by a contested negotiated settlement.

In January 2021, the Commission approved the designation of the Willow Valley Interconnect delivery point as a Group 1 Delivery point. The Willow Valley Interconnect would connect the NGTL system to the Coastal GasLink pipeline [Folder 4097061].
"
NormanWells,"Tolls on the Norman Wells pipeline are regulated on a complaint basis, based on a cost of service methodology. The cost of service is calculated according to the Norman Wells Pipeline Amending Agreement approved by the National Energy Board in 1998. Year-end adjustments are based on the actual full cost of service and throughput for a specific year. Enbridge determines its allowable equity return using the formula from the National Energy Board's RH-2-94 decision. Significant toll increases are attributed to decreasing throughput and increased integrity spending."

TCPL,"From 2007 to 2011, the TC Canadian Mainline operated under a negotiated settlement based on a cost of service toll methodology. 

In 2011, TCPL filed a toll application [Folder 711778]. The NEB’s Reasons for Decision in March 2013 resulted in lower multi-year fixed tolls for Firm Transportation service. It also gave TCPL discretion in the pricing of Interruptible Transportation service and Short Term Firm Transportation service. When the decision was implemented in mid-2013, firm contracts from Empress increased.
 
At the end of 2013, TCPL and three eastern local distribution companies applied for a new toll regime incenting TCPL to build new facilities in the Eastern Triangle [Folder 2397890]. It was approved in December 2014, resulting in higher tolls that were determined based on the TC Canadian Mainline’s cost of service. This toll methodology was expected to be in place from 2015 to 2020, with a review in 2017. In December 2017, TCPL filed an application for 2018-2020 Mainline Tolls and the NEB issued Reasons for Decision in December 2018 [Folder 3413374].

Between 2017 and 2019, the NEB approved several Long Term Fixed Price (LTFP) services, which provided lower tolls in order to retain or attract volumes to the system [Folder 3173691], [Folder 3224371], [Folder 3715883].
  
In April 2020, the CER approved the 2021-2026 negotiated settlement between TCPL and TC Canadian Mainline shippers [Folder 3891141]. The settlement fixes firm tolls on the TC Canadian Mainline for a period of six years, between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2026, and segmented the system into the Western Mainline and Eastern Triangle for tolling purposes.

Note that the natural gas distribution company, Gaz Métro, was renamed to Énergir in late 2017. Subsequently, the delivery point GMIT EDA was renamed to Energir EDA.

"
TQM,"TQM tolls are calculated in accordance with a toll settlement for 2017 to 2021 and are cost-based. The CER approved TQM's tolling methodology in February 2017 (Order TG-001-2017) [Folder 3179270]. The Canadian Mainline has a firm contract for all the capacity on TQM and demand charges are paid by TransCanada PipeLines, regardless of flows."
TransMountain,"Trans Mountain determines its tolls using the methodology set out in an Incentive Toll Settlement (ITS), negotiated between Trans Mountain, its shippers, and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. A new ITS is typically negotiated every several years and submitted to the CER for approval. Currently, Trans Mountain operates under a two-year ITS (2022-2023 ITS). Pursuant to the ITS, Trans Mountain calculates tolls based on an annual revenue requirement and estimated throughputs. Tolls differ based on the type of product, the various pipeline routes (combinations of receipt and delivery points), and the type of terminalling and tankage services a shipper uses. 

Trans Mountain provides committed service to the Westridge Dock in the amount of 54 000 barrels per day of the pipeline’s capacity. Committed shippers pay the applicable uncommitted toll plus an additional fee for this service. The remainder of the Trans Mountain Pipeline’s capacity is made available to uncommitted shippers. Shippers to all land-based destinations pay the applicable uncommitted toll, whereas uncommitted shippers to the Westridge Dock bid on available capacity. The Westridge Dock bid premiums collected by Trans Mountain are refunded to shippers through future toll reductions.
"
TransNorthern,"Incentive tolls on the Trans-Northern pipeline are negotiated with shippers and based on revenue requirements. The annual tolls are for routes between designated origin and destination points within the provinces of Quebec and Ontario and are charged by volume and crude oil quality. In 1996, Trans-Northern's RHW-3-96 toll settlement established a starting point for its revenue requirement, and a mechanism to adjust costs each year. Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc. earns a return on equity equivalent to the RH-2-94 formula rate plus 25 points additional return for risk. In the incentive tolls agreement, earnings above a threshold of $3.2 million are shared equally between Trans-Northern's shareholders and shippers. Shippers receive these earnings in the form of reduced tolls in the next year. Tolls are submitted annually to the CER.

Westcoast,"For tolling purposes, Westcoast is divided into two zones:
1.	 Zone 3 consists of sales gas transmission pipelines north of compressor station 2, near Chetwynd, British Columbia. Zone 3 is also referred to as Transportation North or T-North.
2.	Zone 4 consists of the sales gas transmission pipelines south of compressor station 2. Zone 4 is also referred to as Transportation South or T-South.

Tolls are based on the cost of service, are zone-based, and are term-differentiated (for example, tolls for a five year contract are lower than tolls for a two year contract).
