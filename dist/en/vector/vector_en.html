            <h3>Conditions Compliance</h3>
            <p class="small">Section updated March 2021</p>
            <p>
              Every pipeline company in Canada must meet federal, provincial or
              territorial, and local requirements. This includes Acts,
              Regulations, rules, bylaws, and zoning restrictions. Pipelines are
              also bound by technical, safety, and environmental standards along
              with company rules, protocols and management systems. In addition
              to these requirements, the Commission may add conditions to
              regulatory instruments that each company must meet. Conditions are
              project-specific and are designed to protect public and the
              environment by reducing possible risks identified during the
              application process.
            </p>

            <p>
              Condition compliance is part of the CER's oversight and
              <a href="/en/safety-environment/compliance-enforcement/index.html">enforcement</a>
              action is taken when required.
            </p>
            <p>
              Conditions can be related to a specific region, or apply to the
              pipeline project as a whole. The map below displays the number of
              in progress and closed conditions mapped to economic regions as
              defined by
              <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm">Statistics Canada.
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Conditions can typically be either in-progress or closed. The CER
              follows up on in-progress conditions.

                    <strong>Description: </strong>The above map displays the
                    number of CER conditions associated with projects approved
                    by the Commission. The map is split into two tabs which show
                    in-progress and closed conditions separately, mapped to an
                    economic region. If a company has no in-progress conditions
                    specific to an economic region, the dashboard will default
                    to show the closed conditions by region. An additional view
                    is available which contains the number of in-progress and
                    closed conditions that don't have a corresponding economic
                    region in the dataset. The map regions are shaded based on
                    the number of conditions, with lighter colored regions
                    containing fewer conditions compared to darker colors.
                    Conditions that apply to more than one region are double
                    counted in the map, and these conditions will appear in the
                    map region total and map region breakdown for each
                    applicable region. The condition counts contained in the map
                    navigation buttons represent total conditions without region
                    double counting.

              <p>
                Companies self-report incidents and are expected to take a
                precautionary approach in doing so. This means that even when
                there is doubt as to whether an incident should be reported, the
                company must report it. The approach is, “When in doubt,
                report.” This is consistent with CER-regulated companies’
                responsibility for anticipating, preventing, mitigating and
                managing incidents of any size or duration.

                    The CER reviews all reported incidents to assess whether
                    companies have taken the appropriate corrective actions and
                    to identify potential trends in incidents. Each incident is
                    given a status indicating the current stage of the CER's

                  manner that would cause harm to human life, wildlife or
                  vegetation (e.g., glycol, potassium carbonate, methanol,

                    <li>
                      over-pressures - i.e., pressures that are higher than the
                      maximum the equipment was designed to safely handle;
                    </li>
                    <li>vibration beyond design limits;</li>
                    <li>
                      slope movements causing movement in the pipeline beyond
                      design limits;
                    </li>
                    <li>pipe exposures in rivers or streams; and</li>
                    <li>
                      introduction of an inappropriate product (e.g., sour gas
                      in excess of CSA limits)
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Operation beyond design limit is typically linked to an
                    over-pressure of the product in the pipe; however, if a pipe
                    was exposed to excessive vibration and was not designed for
                    this, this could be considered operation beyond design
                    limits. Operation beyond design limits does not include
                    equipment contacting the pipe, or corrosion pits, etc.

                <strong>Description:</strong> The above map displays the
                location of product release incidents that have occured on the
                pipeline system since 2008. The map defaults to show incidents
                as bubbles which are colored based on the substance released.
                Incidents on the map can be re-categorized based on the most
                recently available status of the CER's incident review, the year
                in which the incident was reported, and the province/territory
                where the incident occured. The incident map bubble can be
                switched to show the estimated volume of product released, with
                larger map bubbles showing larger release volumes relative to
                other product releases on the system. The incident data can also
                be toggled to display a stacked bar chart of incidents over time
                by clicking on the <i>incident trends</i> button above the map.
                The stacked bars dispaly the number of product release incidents
                by year, with bar color segments corresponding to the various
                products released. Similiar to the map, incidents can be
                re-categorized by clicking on the side buttons to view a
                breakdown of incidents by status, what happened, why it
                happened, and province/territory.
