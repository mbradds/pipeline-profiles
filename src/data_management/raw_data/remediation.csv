There is shallow bedrock in this area and contamination has penetrated through it. The movement of GW and the connection to contaminant distribution was not clear. In 2021 TNPI did a hydrological study (Feb to May) and quarterly sampling program. The hydrological study consisted of the installation of pressure transducers to continuously log data. The results of the study showed a strong vertical gradient on GW movement, that the GW recharges primarily from infiltration precipitation and some areas of the site have poor hydrology connection. The 2021 GW monitoring showed that most of the GW contamination is on the bedrock and only one GW well with minor contamination at the overburden. No LNAPL was detected.    In 2021/2022 TNPI developed a risk assessment for the site.

Initial phase II ESA in April 2020 included soil samples and installation of GW monitoring wells at the property boundary. No soil exceedance were detected, only a benzene exceedance on GW in one of the monitoring wells.     The adjacent landowner (potential affected stakeholder and owner of a decommissioned tank farm) was notified of the contamination and request to do next phase investigation on his property. TNPI contacted surrounding industrial neighbors to inform about the contamination and inquire about any information they may have. They indicated that their record show no contamination towards TNPI property.    Phase II ESA to investigate potential offsite impact indicated PAH exceedances in soil (May 2021), GW exceedances in BTEX, PHC and PAHs (June, September and December 2021)",A further phase II ESA will be done in Q3/Q4 2022 to further delineate the contamination outside the property boundary.
