Alliance,"From 2000 to 2015, Alliance was supported by 15-year firm transportation contracts. In 2015, the Board approved Alliance's new services and tolls, and granted Alliance discretion in setting bid floors for seasonal firm service between 100% and 125% of the applicable 5-Year firm toll, and up to 125%, for interruptible service. Shippers pay lower term-differentiated tolls if they contract for service for a longer period of time and tolls are charged by zone. Zone 1 includes all receipt points downstream of the Blueberry Hill Compressor Station near Gordondale, Alberta. Zone 2 includes the Blueberry Hill Compressor Station and all receipt points upstream of that station. Alliance also has a notional point known as the Alliance Trading Pool (ATP) where natural gas can be traded. Shippers have the option of contracting for service to or from the ATP only, or using the traditional full path service."

EnbridgeFSP,"From 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2021, Canadian Mainline tolls were set in accordance with the Competitive Toll Settlement (CTS), a 10-year negotiated settlement. It established Canadian local tolls for all volumes shipped within Canada as well as international joint tolls for volumes transported into the U.S. 

In December 2019, Enbridge filed an application with the CER for approval of a new service and tolling framework, seeking to have it in place when the CTS expired. Enbridge proposed to offer long-term contracts on the Canadian Mainline for up to 90% of the capacity, with at least 10% of capacity remaining available for uncommitted service. In November 2021, the CER denied the proposal. [Folder 3890507].

The Flanagan South Pipeline System interconnects with the Enbridge Mainline at Enbridge’s Flanagan Terminal, near Pontiac, Illinois, and serves delivery points in the state of Texas. Shippers pay international joint tolls for crude oil shipped from Canadian receipt points on the Enbridge Mainline to delivery points served by the Flanagan South Pipeline System. These tolls are based on the various pipeline routes (combinations of receipt and delivery points), type of commodity, volumes, length of contractual term, and open season.

EnbridgeLine9,Line 9 tolls are stand-alone from the Enbridge Mainline system. The Committed IJT toll is calculated as set forth in Schedule B of the Transportation Services Agreement (“TSA”) between Enbridge and the Line 9 committed shippers [Folder 940306]. The Uncommitted IJT tolls are calculated to provide a premium such that the total Uncommitted IJT toll from any Canadian Origination Point to Montreal is no more than 122% of the Committed IJT toll.

NGTL,"Tolls on NGTL are based on a cost of service model. Customers contract separately for receipt and delivery services. In August 2010, the CER approved a new tolls design methodology for NGTL [Filing A25890], which came into effect on 1 November 2010. Under the revised toll methodology, delivery tolls on NGTL are calculated depending on the distance and service offering. Receipt tolls on NGTL are location-specific and are subject to pricing floors and ceilings. In the graphs below, the receipt tolls are shown as an average of rates at all receipt points, as reported to the CER. The delivery tolls are shown as 3 types: an average of Group 1 delivery points; all group 2 delivery points; and all group 3 delivery points.

NGTL operated under revenue requirement settlements for 2010 to 2018. In March 2019, NGTL applied for the System Rate Design and Services [Folder 3752364]. NGTL sought approval of a rate design methodology and terms and conditions of service for the NGTL system, as well as for a surcharge formula to be paid by FT-R shippers on the North Montney Mainline segment of the NGTL system. The application was approved under the NEB Act in March of 2020.

In August 2019, NGTL applied for an amendment to its Gas Transportation Tariff, referred to as the Temporary Service Protocol (TSP) [Folder 3816276]. The TSP would allow for prioritization of interruptible and delivery storage injections over interruptible or firm receipt services to manage system constraints and improve access to storage during planned outage and maintenance periods. TSP would be effective for the summers of 2019 and 2020. In July 2020, the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) applied to extend the TSP [Folder 3950515], which NGTL opposed, and the extension was denied by the CER in February 2021.

NormanWells,"Tolls on the Norman Wells pipeline are regulated on a complaint basis, based on a cost of service methodology. The cost of service is calculated according to the Norman Wells Pipeline Amending Agreement approved by the National Energy Board in 1998. Year-end adjustments are based on the actual full cost of service and throughput for a specific year. Enbridge determines its allowable equity return using the formula from the National Energy Board's RH-2-94 decision. Significant toll increases are attributed to decreasing throughput and increased integrity spending."

TCPL,"From 2007 to 2011, the TC Canadian Mainline operated under a negotiated settlement based on a cost of service toll methodology. 

In 2011, TCPL filed a toll application [Folder 711778]. The NEB’s Reasons for Decision in March 2013 resulted in lower multi-year fixed tolls for Firm Transportation service. It also gave TCPL discretion in the pricing of Interruptible Transportation service and Short Term Firm Transportation service. When the decision was implemented in mid-2013, firm contracts from Empress increased.
 
At the end of 2013, TCPL and three eastern local distribution companies applied for a new toll regime incenting TCPL to build new facilities in the Eastern Triangle [Folder 2397890]. It was approved in December 2014, resulting in higher tolls that were determined based on the TC Canadian Mainline’s cost of service. This toll methodology was expected to be in place from 2015 to 2020, with a review in 2017. In December 2017, TCPL filed an application for 2018-2020 Mainline Tolls and the NEB issued Reasons for Decision in December 2018 [Folder 3413374].

Between 2017 and 2019, the NEB approved several Long Term Fixed Price (LTFP) services, which provided lower tolls in order to retain or attract volumes to the system [Folder 3173691, Folder 3224371 and Folder 3715883].
  
In April 2020, the CER approved the 2021-2026 negotiated settlement between TCPL and TC Canadian Mainline shippers [Folder 3891141]. The settlement fixes firm tolls on the TC Canadian Mainline for a period of six years, between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2026, and segmented the system into the Western Mainline and Eastern Triangle for tolling purposes.

Note that the natural gas distribution company, Gaz Métro, was renamed to Énergir in late 2017. Subsequently, the delivery point GMIT EDA was renamed to Energir EDA.
"
TQM,"TQM tolls are calculated in accordance with a toll settlement for 2017 to 2021 and are cost-based. The CER approved TQM's tolling methodology in February 2017 (Order TG-001-2017) [Folder 3179270]. The Canadian Mainline has a firm contract for all the capacity on TQM and demand charges are paid by TransCanada PipeLines, regardless of flows."
TransMountain,"Trans Mountain currently operates under a three-year Incentive Toll Settlement (2016-2018 ITS). Tolls have fluctuated as over or under-recoveries of revenues are transferred to future years. Tolls are based on the quality of crude oil, the volumes and the specific pipeline path. Since January 2015, consideration of a shipper's previous delivery volumes has helped determine fair and equitable allocation of Trans Mountain system capacity."
TransNorthern,"Incentive tolls on the Trans-Northern pipeline are negotiated with shippers and based on revenue requirements. The annual tolls are for routes between designated origin and destination points within the provinces of Quebec and Ontario and are charged by volume and crude oil quality. In 1996, Trans-Northern's RHW-3-96 toll settlement established a starting point for its revenue requirement, and a mechanism to adjust costs each year. Trans-Northern Pipelines Inc. earns a return on equity equivalent to the RH-2-94 formula rate plus 25 points additional return for risk. In the incentive tolls agreement, earnings above a threshold of $3.2 million are shared equally between Trans-Northern's shareholders and shippers. Shippers receive these earnings in the form of reduced tolls in the next year. Tolls are submitted annually to the CER.
